swi - an ipython notebook on social web intelligence

This notebook started as a companion to the [SFU/UBC Digital Salon Workshop on Social Web Intelligence](https://www.sfu.ca/fass/events/sfu-ubc-digital-salon-workshop-on-social-web-intelligence.html), and has been growning ever since.

The goal of this notebook is to introduce the theory and practice of basic concepts in network analysis, machine learning, and data mining in order to make sense of the social and information networks that have been fuelled and rendered accessible by the Internet.

By going through the content, you will learn about the structure and evolution of networks, drawing on knowledge from disciplines as diverse as sociology, mathematics, statistics, computer science, economics, and physics.

Interactive demonstrations and hands-on analysis of real-world data sets will focus on a range of tasks: from online network data collection, to identifying important nodes in the network, to detecting communities, to opinion mining and sentiment analysis, to predicting future relationships and social attributes.
