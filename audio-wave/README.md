# Audio-wave

Have you ever stopped and wondered how a computer is able to play a sound file or how we are able to record and store sounds?
How does a sequence of zeroes and ones get converted into physical sound that come out through the speakers?
How are all these real-life analogue sound saved as zeroes and ones?

In this notebook, we will explore the physics of sound and how the information is stored digitally inside a raw WAV file.
