    "### 3. Physics of sound\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how sound data can be represented as a sequence of numbers between some minimum and maximum value, let us think about what sound is in the physical sence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is a mechanical phenomenon that can be produced by anything that has a momentum (mass * velocity), and it requires a \"medium\" in which the \"wave\" can travel. Here, medium is just another intermediate stuff with mass; anything other than vacuum will be able to carry sound waves. This mechanical movement carries a specific significance to the observer (the entity capable of sensing the motion) because certain patterns in the motion are recognized and abstracted to concepts such as pitch and volume. If the sound lacks a recognizable pattern, the motion is recognized as \"noise\". But if the sound has a regular pattern, that pattern is recognized and is given a meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we pick the G3 string on the guitar, the string will move up and down 196 times per second. This moving string will push the surrounding air and this motion will propagate through the air particles. Because a guitar string is fixed at both ends and the motion is very regular, the air and the body of the guitar will vibrate regularly as well. The air pushes our eardrums in and out, the eardrums pick up this up and down movement of the air pressure, our brains abstract this movement as sinusoidal wave at 196 Hz, and then we say, \"ah, the G note.\" Similarly, if we pick the D3 string, the string will oscillate 147 times per second. The motion is slower, and we hear the lower D note. Thus, the frequency of an oscillatory motion is interpreted as \"pitch\".\n",
    "* On a side note, the fact that a sound wave with twice the frequency of another sound wave is an [octave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octave) higher in pitch is purely sublime. A3 = 220Hz, A4 = 440Hz. It reveals this fantastically mathematical property of music. [(Read more about intervals)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(music))\n",
    "\n",
    "If we picked the same string harder, the air will move at the same frequency but the string will move further up and down. Each air particle will be pushed and pulled a greater distance as it vibrates back and forth, and every time the air pushes the eardrum, it will push it with more force. The brain recognizes this increase in intensity, or pressure, and we perceive that the note is \"louder\"."
