# Graph-Analysis

You will learn the basics of graph analysis, which is an essential topic in Data and Network Sciences. In concept, a graph represents a useful mathematical model consisting of entities (nodes) and relationships between these entities (edges connecting nodes). This tutorial uses social networks as one application of graph analysis, and introduces concepts such as connectivity, centrality, and visualization of networks.
